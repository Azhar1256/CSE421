# Network Infrastructure

This repository contains the implementation of a network infrastructure project for the Valorant Troops. The project focuses on setting up network connectivity, assigning IP addresses, configuring servers, establishing connections, and ensuring successful communication between zones.

5. [Submission Deliverables](#submission-deliverables)

## Network Topology

The network topology diagram is available in the [diagrams](Lab Project) directory. It provides a visual representation of the network layout and connectivity of the Valorant Troops' zones.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

The IP addressing and subnetting details are documented in the [VLSM tree](VLSM_tree.md) file. It demonstrates the subnet allocation for each branch of the network.

The [IP address table](Configuration_command file_Group 108.pdf) lists the assigned IP addresses for each zone, along with relevant information such as device types and server configurations.

## Network Configuration

The configuration commands for all the routers implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer can be found in the [router_configurations](Lab Project) directory.

## Testing and Verification

To ensure the proper functionality of the network infrastructure, the following tests should be performed:

1. **Ping Test**: Verify successful ping communication between zones.
2. **HTTP Response**: Access the Pearl (P) zone's Web server using the provided URL or IP address and verify the HTTP response message.

## Submission Deliverables

Please find the following deliverables for the project submission:

1. [Network Topology Diagram](Topology Diagram_Group 108.png)
2. [VLSM Tree](VLSM_tree.md)
3. [IP Address Table](Configuration_command file_Group 108.pdf)
4. [Router Configuration Commands](The Valorant Troops_Group 108.pkt)
